# Virtual Gym Buddy

Welcome to **Virtual Gym Buddy**! This project provides virtual assistance for workout counting using computer vision.

## Features
- Bicep Curls counting
- Squats counting
- Wall Sit timer
- Real-time feedback through your webcam

## How It Works
The application uses **OpenCV** and **Mediapipe** for real-time pose detection and counting specific workout movements. It tracks body positions and increments the count when a full movement is detected.
